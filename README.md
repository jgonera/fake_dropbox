fake_dropbox
============

fake_dropbox is a simple fake implementation of the Dropbox API written in Ruby
using the Sinatra framework. It can be used to mock Dropbox when developing and
testing applications that use Dropbox. There are no real authentication and
users (you are always authenticated), files are stored on the local machine.

Can be used either as a standalone app listening on a port or intercept calls to
the real Dropbox in Ruby apps.

It implements the following API calls from [Dropbox API version 1][] (some may
be only partially implemented):

* /files (GET)
* /files_put
* /files (POST)
* /metadata
* /media
* /fileops/create_folder
* /fileops/delete

`/media` returns working fake download URLs, though they don't actually expire.
Also, fake_dropbox emulates a Dropbox account with [Public folder access][]
enabled, so requesting `http://dl.dropbox.com/u/<uid>/path/file.ext` will
download `/Public/path/file.ext` without requiring authentication.
(any string works as a UID, since `/account/info` is not implemented yet)

All the calls which are also present in [Dropbox API version 0][] should behave
as they behave in the official Dropbox API when version is set to 0 (e.g.
/files (POST) returns `{"result": "winner!"}` instead of file's metadata in
version 0).

If you find it useful and want to add support for more features, go ahead ;)

Installation
------------

Using RubyGems:

```
gem install fake_dropbox
```

To get the latest development version just clone the repository:

```
git clone git://github.com/jgonera/fake_dropbox.git
cd fake_dropbox
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Then, if you want to install it as a gem:

```
rake install
```


How to use
----------

### Running the server

If you installed fake_dropbox as a gem, you should be able to run:

```
DROPBOX_DIR=/home/joe/somedir fake_dropbox [PORT]
```

You have to specify an environment variable `DROPBOX_DIR` which will point the
server to the directory on which the fake API should operate. Additionally, you
can specify a custom port (default is 4321).

If you cloned the repository and you don't want to install fake_dropbox as a
gem, you can run it using `rackup` while in the fake_dropbox directory:

```
DROPBOX_DIR=/home/joe/somedir rackup
```

### Intercepting requests in Ruby apps

You can also use this gem to intercept requests to Dropbox in your Ruby app,
without modifying any of its code or specifying a custom host or port. This
is achieved by using the [WebMock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) library.

The class responsible for this is `FakeDropbox::Glue`. To intercept requests to
the real Dropbox, just instantiate this class in your code:

```ruby
fake_dropbox = FakeDropbox::Glue.new
```

You can provide an optional argument to the constructor, pointing to the
directory you want to use for your fake Dropbox:

```ruby
fake_dropbox = FakeDropbox::Glue.new('/home/joe/somedir')
```

If you don't provide it, a temporary directory will be created in the system's
temporary path.

Moreover:

* `#dropbox_dir` returns the fake Dropbox directory.
* `#empty!` deletes everything in the `dropbox_dir` *recursively*.
  Even though it should work only if the `dropbox_dir` resides inside the
  system's temporary path, you should use it with caution.

A support file for Cucumber tests could look like this:

```ruby
require 'fake_dropbox'

fake_dropbox = FakeDropbox::Glue.new

After do
  fake_dropbox.empty!
end
```

### Configuration

fake_dropbox supports a few configuration options that can be changed after
initialization. They can be changed in two ways:

* by setting `FakeDropbox::Config.<option>` when using inside a Ruby app,
* by sending a `POST` request to `/__config__` containing options and their
  values as parameters (use `true` and `false` strings as boolean equivalents).

The following options are available:

* `authorize_request_token`, default: `true`
* `authorize_access_token`, default: `true`
* `authorized`, default: `true`, when set to `false` all API requests return
  `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status
* `debug`, default: `DROPBOX_DEBUG` environmental variable or `false`, if set
  to `true` reports all the API requests to STDIO (URL, HTTP headers and body).
